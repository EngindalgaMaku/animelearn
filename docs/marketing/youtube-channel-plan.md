Prompt

Clean 16:9 YouTube channel banner for an interactive Python platform. Dark premium UI collage: left third shows a code editor with pass checks and a compact terminal; right two‑thirds show activity tiles (quiz, memory, drag‑drop, fill blanks), a quest card complete tick, a streak counter, a slim badge row, small diamonds and a rising line chart. Cyan #00E5FF and violet #7C4DFF accent glows. Photorealistic UI/3D hybrid with soft parallax and particles. No embedded text. No logos. Leave central safe area uncluttered.

- Add a small corner badge (Code Arena, Tips, Algorithms, Project).

  4.4 Motion package (Veo 3)

5 s intro (no VO)

Modern intro animation for an interactive Python platform named Zumenzu. Panels slide in: code editor with green checks, activity tiles illuminate, quest card ticks complete, badge row glints, diamonds sparkle subtly. Cyan #00E5FF and violet #7C4DFF accents, dark UI, subtle particles. Smooth parallax camera, no jitter, minimal motion blur. End on a clean lockup space for the wordmark and episode title (overlay later).

Parameters: 16:9, 5 s, 30 fps, loop false; negative prompts as above.

1.5 s transition

Quick wipe via a glowing cyan strip revealing the next scene; faint grid and particle trail; clean, minimal.

5 s outro (CTA)

Outro animation that echoes the intro; UI panels drift to reveal a dark area with large CTA overlays: Subscribe • Start free • Next video. Keep motion calm; maintain brand colors; no VO.

Lower‑third

Minimal lower‑third strap slides in from left with cyan underline and violet glow; place for section title like Code Arena or Algorithm Insight; 1.2 s in/out.

Background loops

8–10 s subtle loop of UI panels drifting horizontally; perfect loop; use for cold opens, end screens, and Shorts background.

Delivery: export at 3840×2160; if alpha not supported, render on pure green for chroma key, or on black and use luma key.

4.5 End screen background (Imagen)

1920×1080 cinematic dark plate with safe zones for two video cards on the left and a subscribe circle on the right; keep glow elements and a faint grid.
