Brand and style constraints

- Visual tone: Modern, tech-education, clean dark UI with neon accents; subtle anime-inspired motion without referencing specific IP
- Color accents: Electric cyan #00E5FF and violet #7C4DFF; dark charcoal backgrounds
- UI motifs: Code editor panels, terminal feeds, progress bars, badges, quest cards, streak flames, minimal particle glow
- Typography: Large, crisp, high-contrast; avoid excessive motion blur; prioritize readability
- Voiceover: None by default (VO: off). Use concise, legible on-screen text synced to beats
- Content coverage: Code Arena, 11 activity types across 4 categories, quizzes and memory games, daily mini-quiz, streaks, XP/badges, diamonds, card packs/shop, progress dashboard, Python Tips widget (VS Code-like)
- Safety and IP policy: Do not show copyrighted anime characters, TV/movie/brand logos, or trademarked marks; keep all visuals generic and original

Global negative prompt

No copyrighted characters or logos; no licensed brand marks; no hyperreal human faces; no gore/violence; no seizure-inducing strobe; avoid heavy lens flares; avoid noisy grain and banding; no jittery camera; no unreadable text; avoid over-saturated neon; do not display Stripe/Shopier logos; keep UI generic and original.

Usage notes

- On-screen text should be sharp, minimal, and readable on small screens
- Keep camera motion smooth; prioritize parallax and micro moves over quick cuts
- UI should feel authentic: code panes, pass/fail checks, small success ticks, subtle HUD
- Maintain color consistency (#00E5FF, #7C4DFF) across scenes
