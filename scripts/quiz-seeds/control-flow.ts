    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "The `range()` function can take a third argument for the step. A negative step, like -1, is used for counting down. The stop value (0) is not included in the output.",

      "A syntax error.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Since the condition `True` is always true, a `while True` loop will never terminate on its own. It's a common pattern for loops that wait for a specific event, which then triggers a `break`.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",

      "To pass a variable to a function.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The `pass` statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. It's useful as a placeholder in `if` blocks, function definitions, or classes that you plan to implement later.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "A `for` loop can iterate directly over a string. In each iteration, the loop variable (`char`) takes the value of the next character. The `print()` function adds a newline by default.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The `while` loop continues as long as `count` is greater than 0. It prints the value of `count` and then decrements it, stopping after it prints 1 and `count` becomes 0.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",

      "Python does not have a ternary operator.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,

      "A loop that iterates over a dictionary.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "A nested loop is a control flow structure where one loop is placed inside the body of another loop. The inner loop is executed fully for each iteration of the outer loop.",

      "A\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB",
      "A\nA\nB\nB",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "This is a nested loop. The outer loop runs twice. For each run of the outer loop, the inner loop runs twice, printing 'B' each time. So, 'A' is printed, then 'B' twice. Then 'A' is printed again, and 'B' twice again.",

  {
    question: "When does the `else` block of a `for` loop execute?",
    options: [
      "Always after the loop finishes.",
      "Only when the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.",
      "Only if the loop finishes its full iteration without being terminated by a `break` statement.",
      "It executes in every iteration.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "The `for...else` construct is a unique feature. The `else` block is executed only if the loop completes normally, meaning it iterates through all its items and is not exited prematurely by a `break`.",
    difficulty: "advanced",
    category: "Control Flow",
  },

    options: ["Done", "No output", "5\n4\n3\nDone", "An error"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Similar to a `for...else` loop, the `else` block of a `while` loop only executes if the loop's condition becomes false. If the loop is exited by a `break`, the `else` block is skipped. Here, the loop breaks when `i` becomes 2.",

    options: ["0\n1\n3\n4", "0\n1\n2\n3\n4", "0\n1", "0\n1\n2"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration. When `i` is 2, the condition is met, `continue` is executed, and the `print(i)` statement is skipped for that iteration only.",
    difficulty: "advanced",

      "What is the value of `result`? `age = 15; result = 'kid' if age < 13 else 'teenager'`",
    options: ["'kid'", "'teenager'", "True", "An error"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "This is a ternary conditional expression. Since the condition `age < 13` (15 < 13) is false, the value after the `else` keyword is assigned to the `result` variable.",
    difficulty: "advanced",
    category: "Control Flow",

  {
    question:
      "What is the scope of a variable declared inside a `for` loop in Python?",
    options: [
      "It is only accessible inside the `for` loop.",
      "It is accessible inside the loop and in the `else` block.",
      "It 'leaks' and is accessible in the surrounding scope after the loop finishes.",
      "It is only accessible in the final iteration.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Unlike some other languages, Python does not have a separate block scope for loops. A variable assigned in a `for` loop will exist in the parent scope and hold the value from the last iteration after the loop completes.",

      "`if x or y:`",
      "`if x: else: if y:`",
      "`if not x: if not y:`",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "The `and` operator requires both operands to be truthy. This is logically equivalent to a nested `if` statement, where the inner block is only reachable if the outer condition is met.",

  {
    question: "What's the output? `for x in []: print('A'); else: print('B')`",
    options: ["A", "B", "No output", "A\nB"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The `for` loop iterates over an empty list, so it completes its 'full iteration' (of zero items) immediately without ever running the loop body. Therefore, the `else` block is executed.",
    difficulty: "advanced",
    category: "Control Flow",

  {
    question:
      "What is the primary difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?",
    options: [
      "There is no difference.",
      "A `for` loop is used for definite iteration (over a known sequence), while a `while` loop is for indefinite iteration (until a condition becomes false).",
      "A `while` loop is always faster.",
      "A `for` loop can't be infinite, but a `while` loop can.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "This is the fundamental conceptual difference. Use a `for` loop when you know how many times you want to loop or have a sequence to iterate over. Use a `while` loop when you need to loop as long as a certain condition holds true.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",

    question:
      "What does the following expression evaluate to? `x = 'A' if 0 else 'B'`",
    options: ["'A'", "'B'", "True", "False"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "This uses the ternary operator with Python's 'truthiness' rules. The number 0 evaluates to False in a boolean context. Therefore, the expression after `else` is chosen.",

    options: ["2\n3\n4\n5", "2\n3\n4", "3\n4\n5", "2\n5"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "`range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` up to (but not including) `stop`. So, it produces 2, 3, and 4.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Python doesn't have a built-in `do-while` loop. The common pattern to ensure the loop body runs at least once is to use an infinite `while True` loop and place the conditional `break` at the end.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "The loop prints 1. When i becomes 2, `continue` skips the print. Then it prints 3, 4, and 5. `end=''` keeps them on the same line.",

      "When you want a loop to run at least once.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The `for` loop is designed for definite iteration, meaning it runs for a predictable number of times based on the length of the sequence (list, string, range, etc.) it is iterating over.",

    options: ["A", "B", "C", "No output"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The first condition `if []` is false because an empty list is falsy. The program then checks the `elif [1]:`. A non-empty list is truthy, so this condition is true, and 'B' is printed.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The loop iterates for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The `if` block (for even numbers) runs for 0, 2, 4 (3 times). The `else` block (for odd numbers) runs for 1, 3 (2 times). So `x` becomes 3 and `y` becomes 2.",

      "A statement that defines a function.",
      "A statement that creates a variable.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "`break`, `continue`, and `return` are considered jump statements because they interrupt the normal sequential flow of execution and jump control to a new location.",

    options: ["A", "B", "True", "An error"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Operator precedence is `not`, then `and`, then `or`. `not x` is `False`. `y and False` is `False`. `x or False` (which is `True or False`) is `True`. So, the `if` block executes.",

      "A series of `if` statements can execute multiple blocks of code.",
      "Both B and C are correct.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "In an `if-elif-else` structure, only the first true condition's block is executed. In a series of separate `if` statements, each condition is checked independently, and multiple blocks could potentially run.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "`range(1, 1)` tries to generate numbers starting at 1 and stopping before 1. Since it's already at the stop value, the sequence is empty, and the loop body never runs.",

      "When you want to loop in reverse.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The `while` loop's strength is indefinite iteration. It's perfect for scenarios like waiting for user input, processing a data stream, or running a simulation until a goal is met.",

    options: ["'A'", "'B'", "'C'", "'D'"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "This is a chained ternary expression. `x=='B'` is false, so it evaluates the first `else`. This leads to the second ternary: `'B' if x=='C' else 'D'`. Since `x=='C'` is true, the result is 'B'.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "The loop starts with x=10. First iteration: x becomes 8, prints 8. Second: x becomes 6, prints 6. Third: x becomes 4, prints 4. Now `x > 5` is false, so the loop terminates.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "In Python's truthiness rules, the only number that is 'falsy' is 0. All other numbers, including negative numbers like -1, are 'truthy'. Therefore, the `if` block is executed.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "An `else` statement must be preceded by an `if` (or `elif`) block. An `if` block cannot be empty before an `else`, it needs at least one statement, even if it's just `pass`.",
